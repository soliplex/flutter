/// Observer interface for HTTP traffic monitoring.
///
/// Implementations can log requests, track metrics, or display debug info.
/// Observers should NOT modify requests/responses or throw exceptions that
/// would break the request flow. Any exceptions thrown by observers are
/// caught and ignored by `ObservableHttpClient`.
///
/// Example:
/// ```dart
/// class LoggingObserver implements HttpObserver {
///   @override
///   void onRequest(HttpRequestEvent event) {
///     print('${event.method} ${event.uri}');
///   }
///
///   @override
///   void onResponse(HttpResponseEvent event) {
///     print('${event.statusCode} (${event.duration.inMilliseconds}ms)');
///   }
///
///   @override
///   void onError(HttpErrorEvent event) {
///     print('Error: ${event.exception.message}');
///   }
///
///   @override
///   void onStreamStart(HttpStreamStartEvent event) {
///     print('Stream started: ${event.method} ${event.uri}');

///   @override
///   void onStreamEnd(HttpStreamEndEvent event) {
