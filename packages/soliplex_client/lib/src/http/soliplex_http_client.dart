/// Implementations wrap platform-specific HTTP clients to provide a unified

/// pure-Dart implementation using `package:http`.
///
/// Example:
/// ```dart
/// final client = DartHttpClient();
/// final response = await client.request(
///   'GET',
///   Uri.parse('https://api.example.com/data'),
/// );
/// print(response.body);
/// client.close();
/// ```

  /// - [method]: HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, etc.)
  /// - [uri]: The request URI
  /// - [headers]: Optional request headers
  /// - [body]: Optional request body. Supported types:
  ///   - `String`: Sent as-is with UTF-8 encoding
  ///   - `List<int>`: Sent as raw bytes
  ///   - `Map<String, dynamic>`: JSON encoded automatically
  /// - [timeout]: Request timeout. Uses client's default if not specified.
  ///
  /// Throws `NetworkException` on connection failures or timeouts.
  /// Throws `CancelledException` if the request was cancelled.

  /// - [method]: HTTP method (typically GET or POST)
